CS50P – Lectures 0, 1, 2 Notes

Lecture 1 – Conditionals
•	Scope – the context within a variable which exists.
•	Python comes with a lot of built-in syntax. 
•	> greater than
•	>= greater than or equal to
•	< less than
•	<= less than or equal to 
•	== equality and comparing
•	!= not equal to 
•	if ask questions for the execution of True and False. 
•	x < y is a Boolean expression, True or False, Yes or No. 
•	Indentation makes sure that a line is executed IF that specific Boolean expression it True or False. 
•	elif is a conjunction of Else If. This allows us to ask question and take account whether the previous question was true or false. 
•	else is used at the end of an if conditional statement. You can use this to assume any answers for Boolean expressions. 
•	This makes fewer building blocks within the code, which will ultimately make it faster and more reliable to run. 
•	or is used to for asking questions such as x or x. 
•	and is used as a conjunction of questions which are asked at once. 
•	You can ask and create Boolean expressions for upper and lower bounds. 
•	% Creates the remainder of a number when it is divided. 
•	boolean (bool) values can only be True or False.
