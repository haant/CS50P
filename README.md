# CS50P
CS50P an Introduction to Programming with Python. My notes as well as projects. 

# About
CS50’s team is in the process of filming a brand-new course, CS50P, an Introduction to Programming with Python, inspired by a similar course at Harvard Summer School, designed to prepare students at Harvard College for CS50 itself.

Starting April 2022, CS50P will be freely available to anyone online via edX at cs50.edx.org/python and via OpenCourseWare at cs50.harvard.edu/python.

Recall that CS50 itself, also known as CS50x, is an Introduction to Computer Science. Whereas CS50x focuses on computer science more generally as well as programming with C, Python, SQL, and JavaScript, CS50P will be entirely focused on programming with Python. You can take CS50P before CS50x, during CS50x, or after CS50x. But for an introduction to computer science itself, you should still take CS50x!

Unlike past courses, which CS50’s team has posted all at once, CS50P will be filmed and posted week by week, which means you can attend the course’s lectures live via Zoom or YouTube! Or, as always, you can watch them on demand afterward.

You’re welcome to attend one, some, or all of CS50P’s live lectures, below. Space is limited, so please forgive if a Zoom Meeting fills up! (Zoom allows up to 5,000 users to register for meetings but only allows 1,000 to attend.) But you’re welcome to watch live via YouTube instead!
