CS50P – Lectures 7 Notes

Lecture 7 – Regular Expressions:
•	A Regular Expression (aka regexes) is a pattern to match some type of data for example user input. It can also be used for validation, for example it can validate if integers are entered into a integer field. 
•	.strip() is able to eliminate any blank/white space created by the user. 
•	re is a library for regular expressions. There are a lot of capabilities to check for and validate patterns. 
•	Documentation for re: https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html
•	re.search(pattern, string, flags=0) 
•	. any character except a newline  
•	* 0 or more repetitions 
•	+ 1 or more repetitions 
•	? 0 or 1 repetition 
•	{m} m repetitions 
•	{m,n} m-n repetitions 
•	^ matches the start of the string 
•	$ matches the end of the string just before the newline at the end of the string 
•	[] set of characters 
•	[^] complementing the set 
•	a-z can be used instead of typing through 26 letters of the alphabet in Python (same can be done for upper case). 
•	0-9 can be used instead of typing the range of numbers. 
•	\d decimal digit 
•	\D not a decimal digit 
•	\s whitespace character 
•	\S not a whitespace character 
•	\w word character, as well as number and the underscore 
•	\W not a word character 
•	A|B either A or B
•	(…) a group 
•	(?:…) non-capturing version 
•	flags in re are configuration options which allow it to change some characters. 
•	:= can be used to assign something from right to left AND you want to ask an if question. 
•	re.sub(pattern, repl, string, count=0, flags=0)
